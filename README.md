 Our project well addressed the limitations of the existing system. We designed well organized database management system which is a challenging job in this era. We have built a database for a Blood Bank using Microsoft SQL Server. Before implementing the database, in the design phase, we have explored various features, operations of a blood bank to figure out required entities, attributes and the relationship among entities to make an efficient Entity Relationship Diagram(ERD).  After analyzing all the requirements, we have created our ERD and then converted the ERD to relational model and normalized the tables. Using Microsoft SQL Server we have created the tables for our database and inserted some sample values in the tables. Finally, we have executed sample queries on our database to check its performance to retrieve useful information accurately and speedily and optimized our code to be efficient.
